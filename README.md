# RF Test Task #1: Block Sorting

* **Unity version:** 2020.3.16f1

Robots sort colored blocks into same-colored containers.  
Containers have a queue and begin processing a new block when all previous blocks have been processed. 
Processed blocks are recycled and spawn as new randomly-colored blocks at a random position above the play area.


## Build notes:
Uses the Addressables package. Requires running Addressables' Default Build Script before building the game.
